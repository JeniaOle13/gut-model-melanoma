# Gut Microbiome Modulation in Model Melanoma-Bearing Mice by Probiotic Intervention

## Overview

This repository hosts the complete bioinformatics workflow and analytical results for our study investigating how probiotic supplementation with *Bifidobacterium adolescentis* 150 and *Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus* K32 modulates gut microbiome composition in B16-F1 melanoma-bearing mice. Utilizing Oxford Nanopore full length 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we characterize microbial community changes and identify potential probiotic-mediated shifts associated with tumor progression.

## Key findings
- *B. adolescentis* 150 accelerated tumor growth, linked to *Klebsiella* enrichment.
- *L. rhamnosus* K32 increased *Klebsiella* abundance and reduced microbiome diversity, yet had no significant impact on tumor progression.
